Install the "Box Truck" folder into your 7 days to Die "Mods" folder.

This mod includes mr.devolver's localization script file to make adding mod localization easy! To use it, simply drop "7d2dmodlocloader_46a" into your "Mods" folder and run it. It will go through all installed mods and add their localization, assuming each mod has properly set up its localization.

Thanks to mr.devolver for allowing me to use this script! And if you have any issues with it, he has a thread here: https://7daystodie.com/forums/showthread.php?117843-7-Days-to-Die-Mod-Localization-loader
